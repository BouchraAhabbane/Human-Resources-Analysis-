# SUMMARY

In this project, I used the dataset named (HR-Employee.csv) from www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/data,by using DHinsight Cluster we create a container named human Resource to load our dataset .this data is a CSV file (a comma-separated values file). After creating the container and uploading the data we wrote a sql hive script using the Ambari platform for doing some clean-up, transforming, and aggregation steps to the raw data (creating new data, Rounding, and filtering data). Finally, we create a final visualization that provides business insight, directly solving a particular business problem. 
1)  Creating a histogram comparing the distribution of salespeople with and  without attrition 
2)  Creating a dashboard for Salespeople without and without attrition.
